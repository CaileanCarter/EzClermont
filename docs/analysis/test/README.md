# Testing EzClermont
All the accessions in `sims2013.csv` were downloaded, and EzClermont was run.  The results were inspected manually.  16/19 matched well.  Two of the mismatches were found in the literature to be mislabelled, so we count those as correct.  The remaining one appears to have the arpA fragment that normally is not detected in the B2s.

abstract = {Numerous tools allowing the rapid and universal identification of the clones/clonal complexes/ phylogroups of Escherichia coli have been developed, as it is a commensal of the vertebrate gut, a major pathogen in veterinary and human medicine, and a bacterial indicator of faecal contamination. The ability to identify clones/clonal complexes/phylogroups is crucial, as a strain's ecological niche, lifestyle and propensity to cause disease vary with its phylogenetic origins. There are currently three multi-locus sequence typing (MLST) schemes for E. coli, as well as several PCR-based assays for determining a strain's phylogroup or clonal complex. In this work, we present data that will enable investigators to determine the correspondence between the PCR-based assays and the three MLST schemes, and provide the means for assigning a sequence type (ST) to a phylogroup when no other data on the strain phylogroup membership are available. Such information will help the scientific community to accurately identify the E. coli clones reported in various publications. Although whole-genome sequencing will replace classical MLST and most alternative PCR-based methods, the ST nomenclature of the MLST scheme hosted at the University of Warwick will largely persist.},

abstract = {Escherichia coli is an important component of the biosphere and is an ideal model for studies of processes involved in bacterial genome evolution. Sixty-one publically available E. coli and Shigella spp. sequenced genomes are compared, using basic methods to produce phylogenetic and proteomics trees, and to identify the pan-and core genomes of this set of sequenced strains. A hierarchical clustering of variable genes allowed clear separation of the strains into clusters, including known pathotypes; clinically relevant serotypes can also be resolved in this way. In contrast, when in silico MLST was performed, many of the various strains appear jumbled and less well resolved. The predicted pan-genome comprises 15,741 gene families, and only 993 (6{\%}) of the families are represented in every genome, comprising the core genome. The variable or 'accessory' genes thus make up more than 90{\%} of the pan-genome and about 80{\%} of a typical genome; some of these variable genes tend to be co-localized on genomic islands. The diversity within the species E. coli, and the overlap in gene content between this and related species, suggests a continuum rather than sharp species borders in this group of Enterobacteriaceae.},

Screening of 25 isolates that are genetically related to msDNA-producing clinical strains uncovered 22 additional msDNA-producing strains. A phylogenetic tree based on allelic variation detected electrophoretically at 20 enzyme-encoding loci revealed two major clusters and several deep branches composed of strains that synthesize msDNA. Although E. coli K-12 does not harbor msDNA, other closely related strains of the K-12 family do. The results support the hypothesis that msDNA-synthesizing systems, including reverse transcriptase genes, were acquired recently and independently in different lineages of E. coli.},

abstract = {For many decades, Salmonella enterica has been subdivided by serological properties into serovars or further subdivided for epidemiological tracing by a variety of diagnostic tests with higher resolution. Recently, it has been proposed that so-called eBurst groups (eBGs) based on the alleles of seven housekeeping genes (legacy multilocus sequence typing [MLST]) corresponded to natural populations and could replace serotyping. However, this approach lacks the resolution needed for epidemiological tracing and the existence of natural populations had not been independently validated by independent criteria. Here, we describe EnteroBase, a web-based platform that assembles draft genomes from Illumina short reads in the public domain or that are uploaded by users. EnteroBase implements legacy MLST as well as ribosomal gene MLST (rMLST), core genome MLST (cgMLST), and whole genome MLST (wgMLST) and currently contains over 100,000 assembled genomes from Salmonella. It also provides graphical tools for visual interrogation of these genotypes and those based on core single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs). eBGs based on legacy MLST are largely consistent with eBGs based on rMLST, thus demonstrating that these correspond to natural populations. rMLST also facilitated the selection of representative genotypes for SNP analyses of the entire breadth of diversity within Salmonella. In contrast, cgMLST provides the resolution needed for epidemiological investigations. These observations show that genomic genotyping, with the assistance of EnteroBase, can be applied at all levels of diversity within the Salmonella genus.},

However, even strains with identical MLST profiles (known as sequence types or STs) may possess distinct genotypes, which enable different eco- or pathotypic lifestyles. Here we describe a two-locus, sequence-based typing scheme for {\textless}named-content content-type="genus-species"{\textgreater}Escherichia coli{\textless}/named-content{\textgreater} that utilizes a 489-nucleotide (nt) internal fragment of {\textless}italic{\textgreater}fimH{\textless}/italic{\textgreater} (encoding the type 1 fimbrial adhesin) and the 469-nt internal {\textless}italic{\textgreater}fumC{\textless}/italic{\textgreater} fragment used in standard MLST. Based on sequence typing of 191 model commensal and pathogenic isolates plus 853 freshly isolated clinical {\textless}named-content content-type="genus-species"{\textgreater}E. coli{\textless}/named-content{\textgreater} strains, this 2-locus approach—which we call CH ( {\textless}italic{\textgreater}fum{\textless}/italic{\textgreater} {\textless}underline{\textgreater} {\textless}italic{\textgreater}C{\textless}/italic{\textgreater} {\textless}/underline{\textgreater} / {\textless}italic{\textgreater}fim{\textless}/italic{\textgreater} {\textless}underline{\textgreater} {\textless}italic{\textgreater}H{\textless}/italic{\textgreater} {\textless}/underline{\textgreater} ) typing—consistently yielded more haplotypes than standard 7-locus MLST, splitting large STs into multiple clonal subgroups and often distinguishing different within-ST eco- and pathotypes. Furthermore, specific CH profiles corresponded to specific STs, or ST complexes, with 95{\%} accuracy, allowing excellent prediction of MLST-based profiles. Thus, 2-locus CH typing provides a genotyping tool for molecular epidemiology analysis that is more economical than standard 7-locus MLST but has superior clonal discrimination power and, at the same time, corresponds closely to MLST-based clonal groupings. {\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

abstract = {Salmonella enterica subspecies enterica is traditionally subdivided into serovars by serological and nutritional characteristics. We used Multilocus Sequence Typing (MLST) to assign 4,257 isolates from 554 serovars to 1092 sequence types (STs). The majority of the isolates and many STs were grouped into 138 genetically closely related clusters called eBurstGroups (eBGs). Many eBGs correspond to a serovar, for example most Typhimurium are in eBG1 and most Enteritidis are in eBG4, but many eBGs contained more than one serovar. Furthermore, most serovars were polyphyletic and are distributed across multiple unrelated eBGs. Thus, serovar designations confounded genetically unrelated isolates and failed to recognize natural evolutionary groupings. An inability of serotyping to correctly group isolates was most apparent for Paratyphi B and its variant Java. Most Paratyphi B were included within a sub-cluster of STs belonging to eBG5, which also encompasses a separate sub-cluster of Java STs. However, diphasic Java variants were also found in two other eBGs and monophasic Java variants were in four other eBGs or STs, one of which is in subspecies salamae and a second of which includes isolates assigned to Enteritidis, Dublin and monophasic Paratyphi B. Similarly, Choleraesuis was found in eBG6 and is closely related to Paratyphi C, which is in eBG20. However, Choleraesuis var. Decatur consists of isolates from seven other, unrelated eBGs or STs. The serological assignment of these Decatur isolates to Choleraesuis likely reflects lateral gene transfer of flagellar genes between unrelated bacteria plus purifying selection. By confounding multiple evolutionary groups, serotyping can be misleading about the disease potential of S. enterica. Unlike serotyping, MLST recognizes evolutionary groupings and we recommend that Salmonella classification by serotyping should be replaced by MLST or its equivalents.},

abstract = {No single genealogical reconstruction or typing method currently encompasses all levels of bacterial diversity, from domain to strain. We propose ribosomal multilocus sequence typing (rMLST), an approach which indexes variation of the 53 genes encoding the bacterial ribosome protein subunits (rps genes), as a means of integrating microbial genealogy and typing. As with multilocus sequence typing (MLST), rMLST employs curated reference sequences to identify gene variants efficiently and rapidly. The rps loci are ideal targets for a universal characterization scheme as they are: (i) present in all bacteria; (ii) distributed around the chromosome; and (iii) encode proteins which are under stabilizing selection for functional conservation. Collectively, the rps loci exhibit variation that resolves bacteria into groups at all taxonomic and most typing levels, providing significantly more resolution than 16S small subunit rRNA gene phylogenies. A web-accessible expandable database, comprising whole-genome data from more than 1900 bacterial isolates, including 28 draft genomes assembled de novo from the European Bioinformatics Institute (EBI) sequence read archive, has been assembled. The rps gene variation catalogued in this database permits rapid and computationally non-intensive identification of the phylogenetic position of any bacterial sequence at the domain, phylum, class, order, family, genus, species and strain levels. The groupings generated with rMLST data are consistent with current nomenclature schemes and independent of the clustering algorithm used. This approach is applicable to the other domains of life, potentially providing a rational and universal approach to the classification of life that is based on one of its fundamental features, the translation mechanism.},

Since the start of the 21st century, multilocus sequence typing (MLST) has been used to study the molecular epidemiology of {\textless}named-content content-type="genus-species"{\textgreater}E. faecium{\textless}/named-content{\textgreater} . However, due to the use of a small number of genes, the resolution of MLST is limited. Whole-genome sequencing (WGS) now allows for high-resolution tracing of outbreaks, but current WGS-based approaches lack standardization, rendering them less suitable for interlaboratory prospective surveillance. To overcome this limitation, we developed a core genome MLST (cgMLST) scheme for {\textless}named-content content-type="genus-species"{\textgreater}E. faecium{\textless}/named-content{\textgreater} . cgMLST transfers genome-wide single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) diversity into a standardized and portable allele numbering system that is far less computationally intensive than SNP-based analysis of WGS data. The {\textless}named-content content-type="genus-species"{\textgreater}E. faecium{\textless}/named-content{\textgreater} cgMLST scheme was built using 40 genome sequences that represented the diversity of the species. The scheme consists of 1,423 cgMLST target genes. To test the performance of the scheme, we performed WGS analysis of 103 outbreak isolates from five different hospitals in the Netherlands, Denmark, and Germany. The cgMLST scheme performed well in distinguishing between epidemiologically related and unrelated isolates, even between those that had the same sequence type (ST), which denotes the higher discriminatory power of this cgMLST scheme over that of conventional MLST. We also show that in terms of resolution, the performance of the {\textless}named-content content-type="genus-species"{\textgreater}E. faecium{\textless}/named-content{\textgreater} cgMLST scheme is equivalent to that of an SNP-based approach. In conclusion, the cgMLST scheme developed in this study facilitates rapid, standardized, and high-resolution tracing of {\textless}named-content content-type="genus-species"{\textgreater}E. faecium{\textless}/named-content{\textgreater} outbreaks. {\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

However, disease-associated hybrid E. coli, containing unique combinations of multiple canonical virulence factors have also been described. Such was the case of the E. coli O104:H4 outbreak in 2011, which caused significant morbidity and mortality. Among the pathovars of diarrheagenic E. coli that cause significant human disease﻿ are the enteropathogenic E. coli (EPEC) and enterotoxigenic E. coli (ETEC). In the current study we use comparative genomics, transcriptomics, and functional studies to characterize isolates that contain virulence factors of both EPEC and ETEC. Based on phylogenomic analysis, these hybrid isolates are more genomically-related to EPEC, but appear to have acquired ETEC virulence genes. Global transcriptional analysis using RNA sequencing, demonstrated that the EPEC and ETEC virulence genes of these hybrid isolates were differentially-expressed under virulence-inducing laboratory conditions, similar to reference isolates. Immunoblot assays further verified that the virulence gene products were produced and that the T3SS effector EspB of EPEC, and heat-labile toxin of ETEC were secreted. These findings document the existence and virulence potential of an E. coli pathovar hybrid that blurs the distinction between E. coli pathovars.},

abstract = {A whole-genome phylogeny of the Escherichia coli/Shigella group was constructed by using the feature frequency profile (FFP) method. This alignment-free approach uses the frequencies of l-mer features of whole genomes to infer phylogenic distances. We present two phylogenies that accentuate different aspects of E. coli/Shigella genomic evolution: (i) one based on the compositions of all possible features of length l = 24 (∼8.4 million features), which are likely to reveal the phenetic grouping and relationship among the organisms and (ii) the other based on the compositions of core features with low frequency and low variability (∼0.56 million features), which account for ∼69{\%} of all commonly shared features among 38 taxa examined and are likely to have genome-wide lineal evolutionary signal. Shigella appears as a single clade when all possible features are used without filtering of noncore features. However, results using core features show that Shigella consists of at least two distantly related subclades, implying that the subclades evolved into a single clade because of a high degree of convergence influenced by mobile genetic elements and niche adaptation. In both FFP trees, the basal group of the E. coli/Shigella phylogeny is the B2 phylogroup, which contains primarily uropathogenic strains, suggesting that the E. coli/Shigella ancestor was likely a facultative or opportunistic pathogen. The extant commensal strains diverged relatively late and appear to be the result of reductive evolution of genomes. We also identify clade distinguishing features and their associated genomic regions within each phylogroup. Such features may provide useful information for understanding evolution of the groups and for quick diagnostic identification of each phylogroup.},

@article{Stadhouders2010,
abstract = {Real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) is the current method of choice for detection and quantification of nucleic acids, especially for molecular diagnostics. Complementarity between primers and template is often crucial for PCR applications, as mismatches can severely reduce priming efficiency. However, little quantitative data on the effect of these mismatches is available. We quantitatively investigated the effects of primer-template mismatches within the 3'-end primer region on real-time PCR using the 5'-nuclease assay. Our results show that single mismatches instigate a broad variety of effects, ranging from minor ({\textless}1.5 cycle threshold, eg, A-C, C-A, T-G, G-T) to severe impact ({\textgreater}7.0 cycle threshold, eg, A-A, G-A, A-G, C-C) on PCR amplification. A clear relationship between specific mismatch types, position, and impact was found, which remained consistent for DNA versus RNA amplifications and Taq/Moloney murine leukemia virus versus rTth based amplifications. The overall size of the impact among the various master mixes used differed substantially (up to sevenfold), and for certain master mixes a reverse or forward primer-specific impact was observed, emphasizing the importance of the experimental conditions used. Taken together these data suggest that mismatch impact follows a consistent pattern and enabled us to formulate several guidelines for predicting primer-template mismatch behavior when using specific 5-nuclease assay master mixes. Our study provides novel insight into mismatch behavior and should allow for more optimized development of real-time PCR assays involving primer-template mismatches.},

@article{Vangchhia2016,
abstract = {Unlike Escherichia coli strains belonging to phylogroup B2, the clinical significance of strains belonging to phylogroup F is not well understood. Here we report on a collection of phylogroup F strains recovered in Australia from faeces and extra-intestinal sites from humans, companion animals and native animals, as well as from poultry meat and water samples. The distribution of sequence types was clearly non-random with respect to isolate source. The antimicrobial resistance and virulence trait profiles also varied with the sequence type of the isolate. Phylogroup F strains tended to lack the virulence traits typically associated with phylogroup B2 strains responsible for extra-intestinal infection in humans. Resistance to fluoroquinolones and/or expanded-spectrum cephalosporins was common within ST648, ST354 and ST3711. Although ST354 and ST3711 are part of the same clonal complex, the ST3711 isolates were only recovered from native birds being cared for in a single wildlife rehabilitation centre, whereas the ST354 isolates were from faeces and extra-intestinal sites of dogs and humans, as well as from poultry meat. Although ST354 isolates from chicken meat in Western Australia were distinct from all other ST354 isolates, those from poultry meat samples collected in eastern Australia shared many similarities with other ST354 isolates from humans and companion animals.},

@article{Clermont2000a,
abstract = {Phylogenetic analysis has shown that Escherichia coli is composed of four main phylogenetic groups (A, B1, B2, and D) and that virulent extra-intestinal strains mainly belong to groups B2 and D. Actually, phylogenetic groups can be determined by multilocus enzyme electrophoresis or ribotyping, both of which are complex, time-consuming techniques. We describe a simple and rapid phylogenetic grouping technique based on triplex PCR. The method, which uses a combination of two genes (chuA and yjaA) and an anonymous DNA fragment, was tested with 230 strains and showed excellent correlation with reference methods.},

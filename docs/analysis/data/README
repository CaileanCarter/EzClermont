use the accessions.txt file with Entrez batchto download all the assemblies as a genomic fasta
Download the metadata from http://www.shigatox.net/new/reference-strains/ecor.html
Use default settings on a tool like http://www.convertcsv.com/html-table-to-csv.htm to get that into a nice table.



Manually copied and pasted table 2 from "Guide to the various phylogenetic classification schemes for Escherichia coliand the correspondence among schemes" Olivier Clermont, David Gordon and Erick Denamur

Downloaded the PRJNA321606 assemblies from GenBank

Added the assembly accessions for remaining strains in the table manually.  5 were missing

Used entrex batch to download the 23 remaining assemblies


Remember to pad the 0s in the metadata so things match up.

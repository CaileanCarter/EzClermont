\subsection{Summary}
The Clermont PCR method of phylotyping Escherichia coli has remained a useful classification scheme despite the proliferation of higher-resolution sequence typing schemes.  We have implemented an in silico Clermont PCR method as both a webapp and as a command-line tool to allow researchers to easily apply this scheme to genome assemblies.
\subsection{Availability and Implementation:}
EzClermont is available as a web app at  https://ics.hutton.ac.uk/ezclermont/ or https://ezclermont.nuigalway.ie.  For local use, EzClermont can be installed with pip or installed from the source code at https://github.com/nickp60/ezclermont.

\subsection*{Summary}
The Clermont PCR method of phylotyping \textit{Escherichia coli} has remained a useful classification scheme despite the proliferation of higher-resolution sequence typing schemes.  We have implemented an in silico Clermont PCR method as both a web app and as a command-line tool to allow researchers to easily apply this phylotyping scheme to genome assemblies easily.
\subsection*{Availability and Implementation}
EzClermont is available as a web app at  \url{www.ezclermont.org/}.  For local use, EzClermont can be installed with pip or installed from the source code at \url{https://github.com/nickp60/ezclermont}. All analysis was done with version 0.4.0.

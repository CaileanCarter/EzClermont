Initial value of k is 13.
When k is 13 0.84533042500448 of the kmers from the median length sequence are unique.
When k is 15 0.977814955605353 of the kmers from the median length sequence are unique.
When k is 17 0.992838831612397 of the kmers from the median length sequence are unique.
The optimum value of K is 19.
When k is 19 0.994158128850926 of the kmers from the median length sequence are unique.

There were 95 genomes.
The median length genome was 5092218 bases.
